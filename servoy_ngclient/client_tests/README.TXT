   package.json - defines the wc2 unit test module with it's dependencies to karma and helpers.

To run karma from command line run :"node ./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start karma.conf.js"
To debug a test : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15906903/debug-in-browser-using-testacular-now-karma       (if you need to debug more than one minute set 'singleRun' to false in karma.conf.js ,run karma  and open http://localhost:9876/debug.html)
To update check if a newer version of a depended library exists use "npm outdated"
To update to the latest stable version do change the string versions in the package.json to '*' and run  "npm update --save" , 
this will update to the latest version and writhe the actual dependent version in package json.
To install a new dependency automatically without needing to modify the package.json  run for example "npm install karma-ng-html2js-preprocessor --save"
