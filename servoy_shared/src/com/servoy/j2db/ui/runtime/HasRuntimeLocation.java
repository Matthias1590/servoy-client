	 * Sets the location of an element. It takes as input the X (horizontal) and Y (vertical) coordinates - starting from the TOP LEFT side of the screen.
	 * Please note that location should not be altered at runtime when an element is anchored. Use the solutionModel in such a situation.
	 * 
	 * NOTE: getLocationX() can be used with getLocationY() to return the current location of an element; then use the X and Y coordinates with the setLocation function to set a new location. For Example:
	 * 
	 * //returns the X and Y coordinates
	 * var x = forms.company.elements.faxBtn.getLocationX();
	 * var y = forms.company.elements.faxBtn.getLocationY();
	 * 
	 * //sets the new location 10 px to the right; 10 px down from the current location
	 * forms.company.elements.faxBtn.setLocation(x+10,y+10);
	 *
	 * @sample
	 * %%prefix%%%%elementName%%.setLocation(200,200);
	 *
	 * @param x 
	 * the X coordinate of the element in pixels.
	 *
	 * @param y
	 * the Y coordinate of the element in pixels.
