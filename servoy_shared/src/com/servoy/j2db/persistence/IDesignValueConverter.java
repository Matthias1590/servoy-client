	 * IMPORTANT: it is possible that the given javaOrDesignJSONValue is already the design JSON value in which case it should be returned as it is. This can happen because
	 * JSNGWebComponent.setJSONProperty(...) applies IRhinoDesignConverter.fromRhinoToDesignValue(...) and then calls WebObjectImpl.setProperty(...) which then applies in turn
	 * this conversion (IDesignValueConverter.toDesignValue(...)). But IRhinoDesignConverter.fromRhinoToDesignValue(...) already returns a .frm design JSON value so applying this
	 * toDesignValue is no longer needed.<br/>
	 *
	 * FIXME: change JSNGWebComponent/WebObjectImpl so that the first argument can only be the java value - it would be cleaner and more predictable.

	 * @param javaOrDesignJSONValue either the persist propety java-world value or an already converted .frm design JSON value.
